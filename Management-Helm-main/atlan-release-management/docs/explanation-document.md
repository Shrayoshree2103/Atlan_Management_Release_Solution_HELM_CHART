# Release Management Improvement Plan

## 1. Major Design Decisions and Tradeoffs

### Problem 1: Large Helm Chart (100K lines)
#### Design Decisions:
1. **Modularization of Helm Charts**
   - Break down the monolithic 100K line chart into smaller, reusable modules
   - Implement a hierarchical structure with parent-child relationships
   - Use Helm dependencies to manage relationships between charts

2. **Incremental Deployment Strategy**
   - Implement partial updates that only sync changed components
   - Use Helm's `--atomic` flag selectively for critical components
   - Develop a smart diffing mechanism to identify minimal required changes

3. **Optimized Templating**
   - Replace complex Go templates with external configuration
   - Implement template caching to avoid redundant processing
   - Pre-compile templates where possible to reduce runtime overhead

#### Tradeoffs:
- **Complexity vs. Speed**: Modularization adds complexity to the chart structure but significantly reduces sync time
- **Safety vs. Speed**: Incremental deployments are faster but require careful orchestration to maintain system integrity
- **Maintainability vs. Performance**: Optimized templating may be harder to maintain but performs better

### Problem 2: Manual Testing Issues
#### Design Decisions:
1. **Automated Testing Framework**
   - Implement a layered testing approach (unit, integration, end-to-end)
   - Develop a parallel test execution engine to reduce test runtime
